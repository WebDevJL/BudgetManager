You can save your data by:
    - selecting all data rows in each table.
    - then you export the data as CSV file (as show on the screenshots Installation/export-data-1.png and Installation/export-data-2.png).
    - you run the database script.
    - you import your data (via the button import that is besides the export button used above).
