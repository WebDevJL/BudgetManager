To store the projects's information, we use associative arrays

The structure is the following and you need to access the array using a key

  array (
    "projectId_X" => array(
      "project_obj" => Object( project ),
      "facility_obj => Object( facility ),
      "client_obj" => Object( client )
      "locations" => array( of Location objects ),
      "tasks" => array( of Task objects ),
      "technicians" => array( of Technician objects )
    ),
    "projectId_Y" => array(
      "project" => Object( Project ),
      "facility => Object( Facility ),
      "client" => Object( Client )
      "locations" => array( of Location objects ),
      "tasks" => array( of Task id ),
      "technicians" => array( of Technician id )
    )
  )

array (
  "ProjectManager_X" => array(
    "project_ids" => array ( of Project id ),
    "technicians" => array ( of Technician objects )
    "analytes" => array ( of Analyte objects )
    )
)

array (
  "Task_X" => array(
    "task_info" => Object ( Task_info ),
    "task_analytes" => array ( of Analyte id )
    "forms" => array ( of Form object or id??? )
    )
)
